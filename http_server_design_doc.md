# HTTP Server Design Document in C

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation approach for building a basic HTTP server in C. The server will handle incoming HTTP requests, parse them, and send appropriate responses using standard socket programming techniques.

## Architecture Components

### Core Components

**Socket Management Layer**
The foundation uses Berkeley sockets (POSIX) for network communication. This layer handles creating server sockets, binding to ports, listening for connections, and accepting client connections. The server socket will be configured to listen on a specified port (typically 8080 for development) and handle multiple concurrent connections.

**HTTP Parser**
A custom parser will interpret incoming HTTP requests by reading raw bytes from client sockets and extracting key components including the request method (GET, POST, etc.), request URI, HTTP version, headers, and message body. The parser needs to handle HTTP/1.1 specifications including persistent connections and chunked encoding.

**Request Router**
This component maps incoming requests to appropriate handlers based on the request method and URI path. It will support basic routing patterns and allow registration of custom handlers for different endpoints.

**Response Generator**
Responsible for constructing valid HTTP responses including status codes, headers, and response bodies. It will handle common response types like HTML pages, JSON data, static files, and error responses.

**Connection Handler**
Manages individual client connections, orchestrating the request-response cycle by coordinating between the parser, router, and response generator. This component also handles connection lifecycle including keep-alive functionality.

## Implementation Strategy

### Single-Threaded vs Multi-Threaded Design

For simplicity, start with a single-threaded implementation using a main event loop that accepts connections sequentially. This approach is easier to debug and implement initially. Later, the design can be extended to support multiple threads or use techniques like `select()` or `epoll()` for concurrent connection handling.

### Memory Management

Implement careful memory management with consistent allocation and deallocation patterns. Use dynamic allocation for variable-length data like request bodies and headers, but consider setting reasonable limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks. Implement proper cleanup routines for each request to avoid memory leaks.

### Error Handling

Design comprehensive error handling throughout the system. Network operations, memory allocation, and file I/O operations should all have appropriate error checking with graceful degradation. Implement proper HTTP error responses (400, 404, 500, etc.) for various failure scenarios.

## Key Data Structures

### Request Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    char method[16];
    char uri[1024];
    char version[16];
    char headers[MAX_HEADERS][2][256];
    int header_count;
    char* body;
    size_t body_length;
} http_request_t;
```

### Response Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    int status_code;
    char headers[MAX_HEADERS][2][256];
    int header_count;
    char* body;
    size_t body_length;
} http_response_t;
```

### Server Configuration
```c
typedef struct {
    int port;
    char document_root[PATH_MAX];
    int max_connections;
    int timeout_seconds;
} server_config_t;
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Socket Server
Create a minimal server that accepts TCP connections and echoes received data. This establishes the networking foundation and tests basic socket operations.

### Phase 2: HTTP Request Parsing
Implement the HTTP parser to extract method, URI, and headers from incoming requests. Focus on handling well-formed requests initially, adding robustness for malformed requests later.

### Phase 3: Static File Serving
Add capability to serve static files from a document root directory. Implement proper MIME type detection and file I/O operations with appropriate security checks to prevent directory traversal attacks.

### Phase 4: Dynamic Content Generation
Extend the server to generate dynamic responses through registered handler functions. This enables creating API endpoints and interactive web applications.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
Add support for HTTP features like persistent connections, chunked encoding, compression, and better concurrent connection handling.

## Security Considerations

Validate all input rigorously to prevent buffer overflows and injection attacks. Implement request size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Ensure proper file access controls when serving static content. Consider implementing basic authentication mechanisms for protected resources.

## Testing Strategy

Develop unit tests for individual components like the HTTP parser and response generator. Create integration tests using tools like `curl` or custom client programs to verify end-to-end functionality. Test edge cases including malformed requests, large files, and concurrent connections.

## File Organization

Structure the codebase with separate modules for networking, HTTP parsing, routing, and utilities. Use header files to define public interfaces between modules. Implement a clean build system using Make or CMake for compilation management.

This design provides a solid foundation for building a functional HTTP server while maintaining simplicity and extensibility for future enhancements.
