4. **How does this change your perspective?** On web development? System programming? Software complexity?

## Final Thoughts

Building an HTTP server from scratch gives you deep insight into how the web works. You've implemented the same fundamental concepts used by major web servers, content delivery networks, and cloud platforms.

The skills you've gained - network programming, protocol implementation, security awareness, and system design - are valuable across many areas of software development.

Whether you continue with systems programming, web development, or move into other areas, the foundational knowledge you've built here will serve you well.

## What's Next?

You now have a solid foundation in:
- ✅ Network programming
- ✅ HTTP protocol implementation
